Java_GUI_Pippin_Machine_Simulator
=================================

Java Implementation of a GUI Pippin Machine Simulator by using singleton design pattern. Final Project done in SUNY Binghamton CS140 "Programming with objects" Course.

Running Instruction:
Please run BigFrame.java under ProgramView package for GUI implementation. For execution without GUI, please run ExecProgram.java under Program package.

With GUI running mode, you could load testing pippin machine language, which is a variant of assembly language into the GUI by clicking on File->Load Source... Then you could select programs such as QuickSort.pip, MergeSort.pip or InsertionSort.pip.

The GUI provide "STEP", "CLEAR", "RUN/SUSPEND" and "RELOAD" buttons.
